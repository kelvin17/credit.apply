# Project Purpose
With over 9 years of experience as a software developer in one of Chinaâ€™s leading internet companies, where most 
development relied on internal platforms and direct use of open-source tools was limited, I built this demo loan credit application system to combine my work experience with modern open-source frameworks and DevOps practices.

## Development stack
- Spring Boot
- MyBatis with MySQL
- Redis for distributed locking
- Swagger for API documentation

## Infrastructure (IaaS)
- Azure managed services for MySQL and Redis to reduce infrastructure maintenance
- Azure Web Service for deploying and hosting the application

## DevOps
- GitHub for code hosting
- GitHub Action for CI/CD pipeline that builds and packages container images, and pushing image to ACR

## Todo
- Implement automated Kubernetes deployment using Helm and Argo CD for multi-region disaster recovery
- Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for enhanced observability and monitoring
- Test Framework: Junit + Mockito + Spring Boot Test

Additionally, this project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my comprehensive understanding and experience in software engineering, aiming to support my pursuit of freelance opportunities.
